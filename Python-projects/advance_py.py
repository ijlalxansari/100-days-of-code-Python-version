# Task 2: Lists and Slicing
# Create a list of numbers from 1 to 10.
# Use list slicing to create two new lists:
# One containing the first five numbers.
# Another containing the last five numbers.
# Print both of the new lists.


numbered_list =[1, 2, 3, 4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

newlist1 =numbered_list[:5]

newlist2 =numbered_list[5:]

print(f"the first list is {newlist1} and second list is {newlist2}")

# Task 3: Dictionaries and Control Flow
# Create a dictionary representing a student with keys "name", "age", and "grades" (a list of three grades).
# Write a function called calculate_average that takes a list of numbers and returns their average.
# Use the calculate_average function to calculate the average grade of the student and print it.
# Use an if-else statement to determine if the student's average grade is passing (above a certain threshold) or failing.
